## Changes list
1. In python3, the return value of map() is no longer list, but iterators, you have to convert iterators to list.

2. Python3's string is Unicode, python2.7 is ascii, so we need to encode the string sent to Arduino into ascii, and decode the string received from Arduino into Unicode.

3. thread should be changed to _thread (Low-level threading API).

4. Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.

5. Delete yocs_velocity_smoother and change from smoother_cmd_vel to cmd_vel.

6. Python3 print need to add parentheses.
